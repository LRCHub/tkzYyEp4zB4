Daddy you, Daddy Houston
This is the hail mary, passion that i'm feeling
You don't know what we talking about
Go to hell, this is God's engineering
This is the hail mary, passion that i'm feeling
You don't know what we talking about
Go to hell, this is God's engineering
This is the hail mary, passion that i'm feeling

I see bitches and new dimensions I ain't touched
Ain't touched
I seen it all, but still feel like I ain't seen enough
Life's tough but fuck it, i like a good fight
And if you think you're stopping me, nigga goodnight
Not quite, I ain't like none of you niggas
I grew up on Jigga, fuck jail
I'm chasing bigger, trying to find me a B
That can grind like me, and still fine as can be
Let's go half on a B

Babies and the billions, stack paper to the ceilings
Still got a long way to go, so fuck chilling
I'm chasing down my ten year plan
These people say I'm the man, but fuck them
I'm still hustling

Just made a mil, trying to make more
I done came a long way but got so far to go
Gotta guard dodging the devil
God first, hard work to the next level

Just made a mil, trying to make more
I done came a long way but got so far to go
Gotta guard dodging the devil
God first, hard work to the next level

Been out the hood for 20 years, but your OG's know me
(They know me)
Been on that same block you're standing on
Dreaming of roadies
Bad bitches and fancy cars, it was all a dream
And it still feels like a dream
I'm living like a king
Addicted to bling bling
It's my only awards
Not a party of the Grammy family,
My trophy's in the garage

Speak slang, outta towners can't understand a thing
But fuck it, i'm already rich in the game, why change?
Fuck fame, I got enough haters speaking my name
I still get to switch lanes in them wide frames
Say my name watch bitches come like a Machiavelli
Been living that thug life but ain't no tatt up on my belly

Just made a mil, trying to make more
I done came a long way but got so far to go
Gotta guard dodging the devil
God first, hard work to the next level
To the next level yeah

Just made a mil, trying to make more
I done came a long way but got so far to go
Gotta guard dodging the devil
God first, hard work to the next level

Niggas get jealous when you keep winning
But fuck it keep living
Ain't shit wrong with a little spending
Been getting paid since the beggining
And everyday I stay hustling to make sure
That's the same way it's ending

Spending all my time on my grind, trying to build something
I ain't living for nothing, I'mma keep hustling 'til
I leave a legacy that's worth more than gold
I put that on my soul. i'mma glow for sho'
So far from Hov, but still got so far to go
Remember school with no clothes?
Under stars in my robes
Picture this, now my dick in better ho's
When you keep it 1000, you can't get exposed

Just made a mil, trying to make more
I done came a long way but got so far to go
Gotta guard dodging the devil
God first, hard work to the next level

Just made a mil, trying to make more
I done came a long way but got so far to go
Gotta guard dodging the devil
God first, hard work to the next level

Incredible, edible, peace out out to you and yours
Catch me on the next LP, the enxt tour
Epic proportions,
Xxt to your sound scan the next to
Me means takin' risks, makin' moves
Breakin' out your comfort zone, welcome to my terrordome
Gritty like the streets of New York... sunny, hot every day like L.A.
Judgement night psychic you might just get hurt

The next level
The next level
Ya'll take it, me take it, I take it to the next level
Take it there, the next level
Take it there, the next level, take it there
Ya'll yake it, me take it, I take it to the next level
You string cheese honkies, break yourself
What I got, what you got, what I need, what you need
Everything you want, everything ya got
What I got, what you got, what I need, what you need
Everything you want, everything ya got

I impeach brothers like speech there's more left
Rock from right to left illwaukee wisconsciousness
Milky baby filthy jump on my handle bars as we blast off to
Mars big smiles with stars
I'd have it no other way every days
A gift call it the present
Grew city brew city yeah I
Represent hometown kids done good... whatever

The next level
The next level
Ya'll take it, me take it, I take it to the next level
Take it there, the next level
Take it there, the next level, take it there

Funky pussy based rhymes
Here my jam with the funky piano
Drop my baritone and make your girl sing soprano
I hope Sony SSO xan clear the sample
Breakbeat MCs here's an example
White sandy beaches with the sun tan lotion
Sex on the beach makin' love by the ocean
PSR me ASAP
On the down and dirty let's get down baby get nasty
Take it off drop your dress to the floor
Guaranteed satisfaction j'adore mi amore
Sexual explicit rhymes that I'm kickin' in your ear
Makes me the pimp of the year

The next level
The next level
Ya'll take it, me take it, I take it to the next level
Take it there, the next level
Take it there, the next level, take it there
Ya'll yake it, me take it, I take it to the next level
You string cheese honkies, break yourself
What I got, what you got, what I need, what you need
Everything you want, everything ya got
What I got, what you got, what I need, what you need
Everything you want, everything ya got
